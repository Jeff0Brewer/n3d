Scientists working with the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) are seeking to understand how the cosmic environment affects star formation and active galactic nuclei.

In our collaboration, the challenge was to intuitively visualize spatial relationships and parametric data cataloged in the NED collection of all known objects in the universe.

We created an interactive web tool that represents the universe in 3D, allows users to select, filter and compare regions of interest. Outcomes CASE STUDY: http://www.peiliew.com/n3d
